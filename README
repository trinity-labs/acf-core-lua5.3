Alpine Configuration Framework 
(A work in progress.)

You can checout from svn to another location and run "make checkpkg DESTDIR=/"
to make sure that all files get included in dist package.

The config file should be in /etc/acf/acf.conf and contain:

appdir=/var/lib/acf/app/

(or wherever your app dir is)
