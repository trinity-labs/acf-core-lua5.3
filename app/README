Each directory has a collection of controllers, models and views
for a specific package.


How to make a new package
-------------------------

Create a directory for your package with the package name.
In this dir you put your controller, model, menu files.

Create a Makefile that describes the the following:

 * package name

 * version of package

 * what files should be installed on the running system

 * what additional files should be included in the distribution package
   (tar.gz source package). The Makefile and acf-pkg.mk wil automatically be
   added so only extra files like README and ChangeLog needs to be specified
   here.

 * just include the acf-pkg.mk makefile which contains the rules to install
   the package and build the dist package-

If you have an acf-foo package it should look like this:

PACAKGE = foo
VERSION = 0.2.0
INSTALL_FILES = foo.controller.lua foo.model.lua
EXTRA_DIST = ChangeLog README
include acf-pkg.mk


Then you just need to create a link to ../acf-pkg.mk

  ln -s ../acf-pkg.mk acf-pkg.mk

To build the distribution package you then run:

  make dist

To install the files in the running system:

  make install
